# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//We made an app that generates romance novel covers. This includes a cover image, a cover title, and two descriptors. This app allows the user to save and select their favorite romance novel covers. It also allows them to create new covers and add them to their saved covers page. Without the features we've included, it would be difficult to remember the novel selected. It also allows the user to create their own covers using elements the user selects and formats the romance novel through our application.]:

### Installation Instructions:
[//Currently, a person will have to be invited to collaborate and then they can clone the repository down to their terminal. Once they clone the repository to their local terminal, they should change into that directory to access the code. They should then be able to open the application through their text editor, and be able to run the page.]: 

### Preview of App:
[// Each iteration was very exciting to create. We both were extremely proud of the make your own cover feature and then storing them to the saved covers page. We had a lot of fun creating different covers and adding them to our feature we created.]:

### Context:
[// We have been working on this project collaboratively for 35 hours. We really wanted to make sure we both understood every element in this project that we came up with.]:

### Learning Goals:
[// Learning goals were to create clean code using javascript along with elements from HTML and CSS to manipulate the page removing and updating elements on the DOM. We referenced the HTML and CSS in order to write our javascript. We were able to work collaboratively throughout the project and with our git hub workflow. Our contribution to the project was an equal effort. We were able to maintain the goals we set within our norms and work respectfully throughout a very challenging project.]: 

### Wins + Challenges:
[// A big win was being able to write our own code and troubleshoot independently prior to seeking assistance from classmates. Understading how to use the DOM and class instances was a huge win. We also never lost sight of our goal, thanks to pseudocoding. Learning how to troubleshoot using the Dev Tools and errors, helped us debug our problems. We initially ran into challenges with having our variables being redundent and not using the correct element from HTML. 

Lexye's challenges: Knowing how to productively research. 
Sam's challenges: Understanding classes and what elements to use from HTML and javascript specifically for storing the pages on iteration three.
